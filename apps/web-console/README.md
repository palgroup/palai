# @palai/web-console — open-core console (E17 T10)

A Next.js admin + live-run console over the Palai **public API only** (§47.6). The API key lives solely in
the server-side relay (`app/api/palai/**`) and never reaches the browser — the same server-relay stance as
`examples/nextjs-sdk` (the E13/E16 decision).

## Surfaces

- **Admin (§47.1, `/`):** organizations, projects, API keys, model connections/routes, secret-ref
  METADATA (the value is never shown), agent revisions + diff, knowledge bases. Every panel fetches a
  `/v1` list through the same-origin relay.
- **Live (§47.2, `/runs`):** start a run and watch its canonical event timeline sorted into lanes
  (messages / model steps / tool+subagent / approvals / usage / recovery+attempt / terminal). The
  **exact approval UI** shows the authoritative action / args / diff / destination / risk / expiry — the
  model's summary never replaces it. Recovery/attempt transitions and artifact download included.

## Public-API-only relay

The browser talks ONLY to `/api/palai/*`:

- `app/api/palai/v1/[...path]/route.ts` — the one generic data relay. It reconstructs the upstream path
  from the browser URL, so the ONLY thing the browser can address is a `/v1/*` public-API route; it
  forwards through `@palai/sdk` (server-side Bearer) and streams artifact bytes.
- `app/api/palai/stream/route.ts` — starts a run and re-projects the canonical SSE event stream to the
  browser as ndjson (lane-tagged), staying open across an approval pause.

## Develop

```
pnpm install                # from the repo root (workspace)
PALAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 PALAI_API_KEY=palai-sk-... pnpm --filter @palai/web-console dev
```

## Prove

```
pnpm --filter @palai/web-console typecheck
pnpm --filter @palai/web-console test:e2e   # next build + playwright: public-API-only + axe + keyboard + UI-002
```

The e2e runs against a deterministic **fake** `/v1` control-plane (`tests/fake-control-plane.mjs`) — no
live provider, no credential spend, nothing to leak. A deployed console against a real compose stack plus
a manual VoiceOver/screen-reader pass is the §6 operator leg above the automated a11y ceiling.

## Honest ceiling

Not a commercial SaaS UI (§5): no billing/team management. The operator console (cordon/drain/queue-inspect,
§47.4) is out — the E15 ops CLIs cover it. Config explainability is minimal (effective value only;
layer-by-layer attribution is a later iteration, §47.3). `console` is advertised **preview** in
`/v1/capabilities`; only the T11 exit gate may recompute it to stable.
